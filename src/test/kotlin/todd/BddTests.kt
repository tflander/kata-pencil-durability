    /*




 When a pencil is created, it can be provided with a value for point durability. The pencil will be able to write only a limited number of characters before it goes dull. After it goes dull, every character it is directed to write will appear as a space. A pencil created with a high point durability will still go dull, but not as fast as one with a lower durability rating.
 Writing spaces and newlines expends no graphite, therefore "writing" these characters should not affect the pencil point.
 Lowercase letters should degrade the pencil point by a value of one, and capital letters should degrade the point by two. Hence when a pencil with a point durability of four is instructed to write the string "text", the paper will contain the entire string. But if a pencil with point durability of four is instructed to write the string "Text", the paper will only show "TexÂ ".
